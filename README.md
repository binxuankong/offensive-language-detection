# Offensive Language Detection

## NLP with Deep Learning - Course work

The task is to develop models to identify and categorize offensive language, outlined here: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20011. More specifically, the task will require systems for three sub-tasks:
- Sub-task A: Offensive language identification: given a text, your system should categorise it into OFF (offensive) and NOT (not offensive).
- Sub-task B: Automatic categorization of offense types: given a text, your system should categorise it into TIN (targeted at an individual) and UNT (untargeted).
- Sub-task C: Offense target identification: IND (individual), GRP (group), and OTH (other).
Each subtasks can be dealt with by building classifiers (2-3 classes).
