This is for the predictions against the testing set of sub-taskA.
The system used to generate the predictions is a single layer convolution neural network (CNN). The model is optimised using Stochastic Gradient Descent and the hyper parameters tuning is done using Bayesian Optimisation.
The overall structure of the model is such:
Embedding Dimension = 100
Out Channels = 180
Window Size = 1
Drop Out Rate = 42%
SGD Learning Rate = 0.0015
SGD Weight Decay = 0.8655
